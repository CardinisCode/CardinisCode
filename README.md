### Hi, I'm Andi ðŸ‘‹  Yes, I'm a lady coder :P

I'm a self-taught developer whose looking to get my first gig as a Software Engineer. 

## My story:
Let's start with those first seeds which led to this point. For my first year in college, I completed an AS level in Information Communications Technology and Business studies. Sadly I couldn't complete the 2nd year due to family reasons, but I truly enjoyed this course. The first programming seeds started when I created an application to help a hypothetical business using Microsoft Excel. It was challenging but I loved the experience! 

Many years later in 2018, I started working through freecodecamp. At first it didn't take, but the 2nd time I gave it a shot, I truly enjoyed the experience. I made the decision that I wanted to start learning how to genuinely code so my partner and I researched a good course to start me off with the fundamentals of programming. So for the next years (or so), I worked through a "Introduction to Python programming" course on edX through Georgia Tech. It was really challenging but I loved the experience. I was really surprised how learning to code actually changed my perspective on learning and challenges in general. The course covered all the fundamentals, of computer programming, from creating variables to creating classes and dictionaries. At this point I didn't know why everyone doesn't use dictionries and classes for everything! LOL 

Moving on, I completed Harvard University's "CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course". Although the course is for anyone starting out, I'm definitely glad it was the 2nd course! The course covered both C and Python, and it was through this course that I started appreciating the value of languages like C that are very memory-sensitive. I was so spoilt with Python as there's no concern for how much memory you're actually taking up. I learnt to research the solutions to whichever problem I was trying to solve and figuring out (through trial and error) what works. 

For the CS50 Final Project, I was tasked with creating something that would benefit either a local community or a specific community online. I had an idea, so using Google polls and Linkedin polls, I put my idea out there (online) to see if people would benefit from such an application. Turns out, I was onto something that everyone (involved) would love to use! So I developed the Job Hunt Manager using Python, Flask, WTForms, CSS, HTML and a dash of JavaScript. The application is aimed at fellow job seekers, looking to store everything related to job hunting in one application. The application is available and live on the internet, so feel free to check it out for yourself:

```

Podcasts like Darknet Diaries & CommandLine Heros have inspired me and fueled a desire to keep learning more about software engineering. Learning to code has definitely woke up a new hunger within me to learn. I don't have everything figured out, but I do know I want to code professionally, so that I can build applications and programs that make the world that little bit better every day! 

## Going forward:

I would love to get a job as a Junior Software developer, preferably as a backend developer, but I'm open to Full stack and Front-end developer roles. In the meanwhile, I plan to continue building projects and network with fellow software engineers - both experienced and fellow aspiring developers like myself. 
Although I am most familiar with Python, I'm open to learn any new language and / or framework that is needed for a role. 


I would love to build projects using
```
* The language: JavaScript
* The Framework: Django 
* Security (security algorithms and even Google's OAuth)
* API's 
* Test-Driven design, using Unit tests. 
* AWS 
```

I'd also love to learn the methodologies: Scrum and Agile working place. Tho It would also be nice to learn methologies at some point too, tho that's my geekside shining through LOL. Bugs are just villians in your code after all - they'll make you better as a developer and you'll be a better code hero as a result. 

Currently I'm building my personal profile site, using Github and Jekyll - as another platform to show case my skills at work. 

## Skills: 
```
Python | Flask | WTForms | HTML | CSS | SQL | C
```

## Background Experience:
```
I have over 10+ years experience in Customer Service & Sales, where I worked face 2 face with clients on a daily basis. I took pride in working together with the client to find the solution that best suit their needs & expectations. I would be more than happy to speak with the client, to get a clear picture of the client's needs and expectations. I've extinguished several fires over the years, where I combined my extensive experience and personality to bring the customer at ease and solve their problem/s. 
```

## Personal Interests & Hobbies:
```
* Playing RPG & Strategy boardgames
* Marvel, DC and Invincible
* Podcasts (see below)
* Going for long walks
* Music: everything from rock, to the blues and EDM. The Queen really gets me going! 
```

### Podcasts: 
```
* Tech related: Darknet Diaries, Commandline Heroes, 
* Job Hunting & career related: The Executive Career Jump, 
* History & Story-telling: Dan Carlin's Hardcore History
```

If the above interests you, I'd love to connect with you. Likewise, f you have a potential software engineering role, I'd love hear it :)

My code-learning adventure has only just began!
