### Hi, I'm Andi ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a Junior Software engineer, with a passion for delivering real-world solutions with a strong focus on user needs, while meeting project specifications. Iâ€™ve honed my skills in Python, CSS, HTML5, and even dabbled in C. 

Additionally, I have a background in digital product designer with 2.5 years of experience. In my previous role, I stayed hands-on with coding while crafting seamless digital experiences. Highlights include:

* Designing, Developing and owning a Gas Safety Project from start to finish. Tools include: Figma, HTML5, CSS, and Apex.
* Collaborating with a systems architect to merge 8 invoice templates into one cohesive design using Salesforce Apex, HTML, and CSS.
* Authoring bespoke email templates across multiple projects.
* Unifying email templates under a single design guideline.
