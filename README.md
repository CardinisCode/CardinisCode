### Hi, I'm Andi ðŸ‘‹  Yes, I'm a lady coder :P

I'm a self-taught developer and I'm originally from Cape Town, South Africa and I'm currently based in London, UK. I'm looking to get my first gig as a Software Engineer. My first preference is to work as a Backend Developer, but I am open to Front end and Full Stack developer roles.  

## Skills:

To see my skills at work, please take a look at the web app [Job Hunt Manager](https://jobhuntmanger.herokuapp.com) I developed recently:

## Going forward:

I would love to get a job as a Junior Software developer, preferably as a backend developer, but I'm open to Full stack and Front-end developer roles. In the meanwhile, I plan to continue building projects and network with fellow software engineers - both experienced and fellow aspiring developers like myself. 
Although I am most familiar with Python, I'm open to learn any new language and / or framework that is needed for a role. 

I would love to build projects using
```
* The language: JavaScript
* The Framework: Django 
* Security (security algorithms and even Google's OAuth)
* API's 
* Test-Driven design, using Unit tests. 
* AWS 
```

I'd also love to learn the methodologies: Scrum and Agile working place. Tho It would also be nice to learn methologies at some point too, tho that's my geekside shining through LOL. Bugs are just villians in your code after all - they'll make you better as a developer and you'll be a better code hero as a result. 

Currently I'm building my personal profile site, using Github and Jekyll - as another platform to show case my skills at work. 

## Personal Interests & Hobbies:
```
* Playing RPG & Strategy boardgames
* Marvel, DC and Invincible
* Podcasts: Darknet Diaries, Commandline Heroes (to name a few)
* Going for long walks
* Music: everything from rock, to the blues and EDM. The Queen really gets me going! 
```

If the above interests you, I'd love to connect with you. Likewise, f you have a potential software engineering role, I'd love hear it :)
